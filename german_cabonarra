you need to buy:

* low fat bacon cubes (low fat is important, there is enough fat in
the other stuff :P )
* cooked ham (as these for bread)
* spaghettis
* vegetable stock powder
* onions
* cream for cooking
* processed cheese
* creme fraiche
* oregano
* garlice
* fresh mushrooms (white)

Slice the onions, the mushrooms and the cooked ham

Power on a pan on high heat, add some vegetable oil.

fry ham, bacon cubes, mushrooms and onions together until they looks
good. add one or two pressed garlic cloves (we prefer two) and let it
fry for short moment

add that much heavy cream as you want sauce, add creme fraiche and processed cheese to make it tasty and creamy :)

let it cook on low and prepare the pasta will that ( i assume you know how )

add pepper and oregano (a lot) to the sauce.

try the sauce, if salt is missing add a bit vegetable stock, But
CAUTION, the bacon cubes are very salty!

add a bit of gouda until you think it tastes awesome

if the sauce get to thick, add some milk.
