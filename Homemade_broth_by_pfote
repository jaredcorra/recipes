get some meat (beef, or a chicken, or pork belly or somethin else), some root veggies (carrots, sellerie, leek, parsley root etc)
clean everything, setup big put with COLD water
add everything, salt a bit (not too much)
add spices (bay leaves, pepper, a onion, a gralic toe)
put on LOW heat
and warm it up slowly
at some point some protein will fall out and create some "dirt" on top
thats needs to be removed .. with a .. aeh. schauml√∂ffel :-D
let it simmer for 1-2 hours or more, depending on the meat
for a tough soup chicken you might need 3h
and thats it
excess broth can be filled in glasses with a screw top (when the broth is still hot) and put into fridge .. they stay ok at least a week when the glass is clean
i always have some glasses with broth in the fridge .. in any case better than water
most important .. start with cold water, and slowly
if you want to have it in higher concentration because you made a lot and have not enough glasses .. let is simmer some more (veggies and meat removed) to create a fond
easy
